# book_inventory
A project called Book inventory that I did while studying software engineering through HyperionDev. This code allows the user to list through an inventory of books. 
With choices you can select options - 
1. Enter book
  2. Update book
   3. Delete book
      4. Search books
       5. Show all books in inventory

Install onto your local computer by simply adding the code to an IDE of your choice.
