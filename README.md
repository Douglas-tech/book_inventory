# book_inventory
A project that I did while studying software engineering through HyperionDev. This code allows the user to list through an inventory of books. 
With choices you can select options - 
1. Enter book
  2. Update book
   3. Delete book
      4. Search books
       5. Show all books in inventory
          0. Exit
